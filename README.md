# Reproducibility study for "Explaining in Style: Training a GAN to explain a classifier in StyleSpace"

This repository contains our experiments in reproducing Lang et.al's  ["Explaining in Style: Training a GAN to explain a classifier in StyleSpace"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13369).

Original Paper Material: [Website](https://explaining-in-style.github.io/) [GitHub](https://github.com/google/explaining-in-style)


## Requirements

If case you want to run our code locally, you need to activate the following environment in anaconda.

We **strongly** recommend running both our notebooks in Colab, since this is the environment we used.

```setup
conda env create -f environment.yml
```


## Training

To train our implementation of the StylEx model in the PyTorch, run the following notebook:

## Pre-trained Models

To save time we provide our pre-trained models and ```.py``` files needed in a ```.zip``` file in Google Drive and load them in the following Colab notebook to reproduce our results.


## Results

To **reproduce the results shown in our paper**, run the following notebook:
